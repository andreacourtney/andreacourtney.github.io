I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar working in the [Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) under the direction of Jamil Zaki. I explore questions related to social connection and wellbeing using a variety of approaches, from social network analysis to fMRI. Before this, I completed my PhD at Dartmouth College, where I worked with Meghan Meyer in the [Dartmouth Social Neuroscience Lab](http://www.dartmouth-socialneurolab.com/) to understand how the brain represents the self and close others.
