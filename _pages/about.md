I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) working with Jamil Zaki. I explore questions related to social connection and wellbeing using a variety of approaches, including social network analysis, experience sampling, and brain imaging. I received my Ph.D. in Psychological and Brain Sciences from Dartmouth College in 2018, where I worked with Meghan Meyer in the [Dartmouth Social Neuroscience Lab](http://www.dartmouth-socialneurolab.com/) to understand how the brain represents the self and close others.
