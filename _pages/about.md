I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) working with Jamil Zaki. I received my Ph.D. in Psychological and Brain Sciences from Dartmouth College in 2018, where I worked with Meghan Meyer in the [Dartmouth Social Neuroscience Lab](http://www.dartmouth-socialneurolab.com/) to understand how the brain represents the self and close others. 

My research applies a suite of methods—including social network analysis, experience sampling, and brain imaging—to the science of loneliness and social connection. I offer a novel account of loneliness as a “self–other gap”, and find that this pattern is reflected in more distinct brain patterns for thinking about the self and others, under-reporting close social ties, and under-utilizing social support.
