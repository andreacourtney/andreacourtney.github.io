* Dartmouth College
Graduate Ethics Course, Facilitator (Fall 2017), Supervising staff: Kerry Landers
	I facilitated a required four-week seminar on research ethics for 12 first-year graduate students. I gave short presentations, assigned case studies, and facilitated group discussion on “Professionalism”, “Mentorship”, “Authorship, Peer Review, and Academic Integrity”, and “Data Collection”.

New TA Orientation, Facilitator (Winter 2015 & Winter 2016), Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, Supervising staff: Cindy Tobery
	For two years I was selected to facilitate a workshop for new graduate teaching assistants. I developed a curriculum and co-facilitated a section on “First Day of Class and Connecting with Students” (December 2015), “Feedback and Assessment” (December 2016), and “Tricky Situations in Teaching” (both years), in addition to	providing feedback during a micro-teaching section.	

Systems Neuroscience with Laboratory, Lab Instructor (Fall 2013, Fall 2014, Spring 2015), Supervising faculty: Jeff Taube, Robert Maue, Kyle Smith
	I instructed a 12-16 person lab section on neuroanatomy that complement the lecture portion of this course for neuroscience majors. This included providing a brief introduction to each lab, directing a sheep brain dissection and Morris Water maze experiment, grading lab work, and designing and grading a lab practicum.

Experimental Design, Methodology and Data Analysis Procedures, Teaching Assistant and Guest Lecturer, (Spring 2014), Supervising faculty: John Pfister
	I led weekly workshops, during an optional class period, where I reviewed homework questions and demonstrated the use of statistical software (SPSS) to organize and analyze data. I also guest lectured on the use of Chi-Square tests for count data, held weekly office hours, and graded homework assignments.

Statistics Summer Seminar for Humanities Faculty, Unit instructor and Statistics Consultant (Summer 2014), Supervising faculty: John Pfister & Christiane Donahue. 
	I was invited to instruct the “Data Treatment” and “Advanced Statistics” components of a one-week Statistics Summer Seminar for Humanities Faculty hosted by Dartmouth College. In addition, I acted as an independent statistics consultant for the workshop participants during this week.

* Wake Forest University
Research Methods and Statistics II, Lab Instructor (Fall 2010, Spring 2011, Fall 2011, Spring 2012), Supervising faculty: Eric Stone & Wayne Pratt
	I instructed a 12-15 person lab section in a course for psychology majors where 			students practiced designing studies and analyzing data using statistical 				software (SPSS). During lab, I reviewed homework assignments and directed in-lab assignments. I also held test review sessions and graded homework 				assignments and tests.
